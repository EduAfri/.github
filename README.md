:busts_in_silhouette: PROJECT SCOPE
This software would take x amount of student (where x is determined by the administrator)

The software will target all kids and teen within the primary and secondary educational sector

The classes would range from Basic 1-9 and senior secondary 1-3.

Upon sign up, a student would be promoted to take an assessment and the result of this would be a criterion for placing the child in a respective class.

An enrolled child would have access to just one class at a time and can take as many courses as allocated to him/her. He or she has the permission to also decline an assigned course.

A child would only advance to a higher class only if they pass the examination for the class whether or not they complete the course work.

A child who fails an examination would have to retake to advance to the next level.
Graduation grade for each class would be based on subject assessment, course completion and exam scores.
